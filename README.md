# Image Resource

This repository is the home of the [image-resource](https://www.w3.org/TR/image-resource/) specification being worked on by
the [Web Applications Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2019/webapps/).

The specification defines the concept of an "image resource" and a corresponding WebIDL `ImageResource` dictionary. Web APIs can use the `ImageResource` dictionary to represent an image resource in contexts where an `HTMLImageElement` is not suitable or available (e.g., in a Worker).
